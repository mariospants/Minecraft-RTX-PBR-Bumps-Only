Convert all albedo/diffuse maps to grey, retain or create MER and Normals... gives an interesting effect.

This texture pack attempts to replace all of the color information for all blocks but retains or creates MER and Normal maps in order to still allow there to be some visible differences between blocks. The end result is pretty fascinating. Lighting does color the blocks.
